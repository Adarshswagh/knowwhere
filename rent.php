    <p>
    A rent agreement is a legally binding document that outlines the terms and conditions of the rental arrangement between the landlord and the tenant. Tenant details, property address, mode of payment, security deposit etc., are some key contents of the agreement. A rental agreement is drafted on a stamp paper and can be prepared for residential and commercial property. These agreements are also called rent deeds or lease deeds. Typically, they are drafted for 11 months to avoid the legal registration.

  <h3>Why is a Rent Agreement Necessary?</h3>
  <p>
    It is always a wise decision to document any arrangement between two parties. Mere verbal contract has no legal value. However, a written rent agreement is admissible in court and can be used in case of any possible disputes. In essence, it is a form of establishing transparency and accountability in the landlord-tenant relationship. It plays a critical role in ensuring that no party is exploited in any form by the other.
  </p>

  <h3>Registered Rent Agreement</h3>
  <p>
    Property is a precious asset, and every step should be taken to safeguard it. Formally registering an agreement provides legal validation for the setup. Moreover, a registered rent agreement is often required for various official and financial transactions, making it an essential document for both parties involved in the rental transaction. The Registration Act, 1908, mandates the lease out of all properties for more than 11 months to be legally registered. Properties rented for less than 11 months may not require registration, but can be notarised. Once the draft agreement is prepared, the landlord and the tenant must be present at the sub-registrar’s office. If the two can’t be present simultaneously, the present party can sign a Power of Attorney. This grants the attorney the right to close the agreement.
  </p>
  <h3>Terms & Conditions for Rent Agreement</h3>
  <p>
  An online rent agreement consists of the various terms and conditions that govern the tenant's occupancy of the property during the specified period of time. Some of the key elements of the rent agreement format are listed below: Rent Amount: The monthly amount to be paid by the tenant to the landlord. Time Period: The duration for which the existing agreement applies. Deposits: Any and every form of deposit required, or made, is clearly highlighted in this section. Usage: The agreement also highlights the purpose for which the property should be used (residential, commercial, etc.) Insurance: Commercial properties typically elaborate on the tenant’s contribution to the property’s insurance, if any. Other terms: These include the manner in which any monetary returns or adjustments shall be made. It also highlights how repairs, maintenance, bill payments, parking space use, and other details will be dealt with. Termination policy: All possible termination scenarios, such as the completion of the contract and premature termination, should be duly elaborated upon in the document. Signature Clause: The agreement should be signed by the landlord and the tenant to indicate mutual acceptance.
